# WhatAMess
**Make your Messages app as clean (or messy) as you want.**

_Designed with iOS 16 in mind, tested on NathanLR on iOS 17._

## Description

For far too long has the Messages app on modern jailbreaks been boring! With WhatAMess, customize (nearly) every color possible across the Messages app. Tailor your app to match your device theme, set your background to what you value most, or just get rid of those green bubbles.

## Compatability
WhatAMess is compatible with devices running a _rootless_ jailbreak on iOS 16. ***Rootful support coming soon!***
The tweak was also tested on (and has a few specific hooks for) iOS 17, NathanLR, on a 2018 11" iPad Pro. That was the only other "jailbroken" device I had for testing. Technically speaking it should be mostly fine on iOS 17/NathanLR.

Compatability with the following is unknown/uncertain as I don't have the devices to test it. Again, logically speaking, it _should_ as this is simple enough. If the tweak works on any of these, _please let me know_:
- Seratonin
- Roothide / Bootstrap
- Palera1n (I assume so?)
