# WhatAMess
***Make your Messages app as clean (or messy) as you want.***

_Designed with iOS 16 in mind, tested on NathanLR on iOS 17. MAY work on iOS 15, but currently untested._

## Description

For far too long has the Messages app on modern jailbreaks been boring! With WhatAMess, customize (nearly) every color possible across the Messages app. Tailor your app to match your device theme, set your background to what you value most, or just get rid of those green bubbles.
